For Cousera project 
1) Introduction/Business Problem
An entrepreneur, who just arrived Toronto and want to start his own business. However, he had no idea where he should place his restaurant and which neighborhood he should target at. After a day, he came to you and wanted to consult about his dilenma. You, as a professional consultant, will need to solve his problem. 
The idea of this study is to help people planning to open a new restaurant in Toronto to chose the right location by providing data about the income and population of each neighborhood as well as the competitors already present on the same regions.

2ï¼‰Downloading and Prepping Data
To solve this problem, the following information are neeeded: the population distribution for Toronto, the average income per Neighborhood, the Toronto neighborhood's shape, as well as some information about the competitors. 
To provide the stakeholders the necessary information I'll be combining Toronto's 2016 Census that contains Population, Average income per Neighborhood with Toronot's Neighborhoods shapefile and Foursquare API to collect competitors on the same neighborhoods.
