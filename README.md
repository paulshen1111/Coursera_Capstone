1) Introduction/Business Problem
Imagine the following scenario:

a)You want to open a restaurant in Toronto, but have no idea which place choose. Especially concerning the surrounding competitors and income level of that neighborhood.

b)You opened a restaurant in Toronto. The business grew well in the past years, it was time for you to open another branch for developing business. However, it was a hard choice for you since you are worrying about the new branch will cannibalize each other's market share. Therefore it was critical to select a propriate position for new branch. 

The idea of this study is to help people planning to open a new restaurant in Toronto to chose the right location by providing data about the income and population of each neighborhood as well as the competitors already present on the same regions.This study is for the convinience of those people who are interested in start a restaurant business in Toronto.
